# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL


#IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL  :



Tools and Libraries Used:

1 . Python: The main programming language I used to build the project.

2 . TensorFlow: A popular machine learning library that helps create and train models.

3 . Keras: It's a part of TensorFlow that makes it easier to build neural networks.

4 . layers & models: These are tools from Keras that help set up the structure of the CNN (Convolutional Neural   Network).

5 . Matplotlib: Used this to make graphs and visualize the model's accuracy and loss.

6 . NumPy: Helps with number crunching and managing arrays, especially when working with image data like the   CIFAR-10 dataset.

7 . Google Colab: I used Colab to run my code online. It’s great because it gives free access to GPUs, which speeds up    training. It’s also easy to share and use with others.

#WHERE THIS CANE BE USED  :

Image Recognition: This kind of model can help in areas like identifying diseases in medical scans, detecting objects in self-driving cars, or even recognizing faces for security.

Computer Vision Tasks: It’s useful for any application where a computer needs to “see” and understand images.

Real-time Image Sorting: Once trained, the model can be used in apps or websites that need to quickly figure out what’s in an image.

Transfer Learning: You can also use this model as a starting point and tweak it for other image tasks, even if you don’t have a lot of training data.
