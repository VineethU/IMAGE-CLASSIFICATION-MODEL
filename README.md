# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL


#Image Classification Model::
Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: The main programming language I used to build the project.

TensorFlow: A popular machine learning library that helps create and train models.

Keras: It's a part of TensorFlow that makes it easier to build neural networks.

layers & models: These are tools from Keras that help set up the structure of the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).

Matplotlib: Used this to make graphs and visualize the model's accuracy and loss.

NumPy: Helps with number crunching and managing arrays, especially when working with image data like the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Google Colab: I used Colab to run my code online. It’s great because it gives free access to GPUs, which speeds up training. It’s also easy to share and use with others.

#Where This Can Be Used:

Image Recognition: This kind of model can help in areas like identifying diseases in medical scans, detecting objects in self-driving cars, or even recognizing faces for security.

Computer Vision Tasks: It’s useful for any application where a computer needs to “see” and understand images.

Real-time Image Sorting: Once trained, the model can be used in apps or websites that need to quickly figure out what’s in an image.

Transfer Learning: You can also use this model as a starting point and tweak it for other image tasks, even if you don’t have a lot of training data.
